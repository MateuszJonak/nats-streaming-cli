# NATS Streaming CLI

This is a simple CLI to publish some message to NATS Streaming.
It was developed only for test how NATS Streaming works.
I plan to add more stuff like for example subscriber in the future.
Stay tuned. 

## How it's working?

The easiest way to run is to use a command for example:

```
node app pub test-cluster subject message
```

For more information You can run CLI with `--help` flag.
